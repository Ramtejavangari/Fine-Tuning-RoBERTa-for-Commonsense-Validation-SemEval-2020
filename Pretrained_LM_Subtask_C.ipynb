    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will work on the [ComVE](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/21080) shared task that was part of SemEval-2020. The task aims to evaluate whether a system can distinguish if a natural language statement makes sense to humans or not and provide a reason. **ConVE** includes three subtasks that require models to acquire and apply commonsense knowledge. In this notebook you will focus on **SubTask C**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Given a statement that does not make sense, generate the reason why this statement does not make sense. For each nonsensical statement, three valid reasons are given as reference:\n",
    "\n",
    "     *Statement*: He put an elephant into the fridge.  \n",
    "     *Reason A*: An elephant is much bigger than a fridge.  \n",
    "     *Reason B*: A fridge is much smaller than an elephant.  \n",
    "     *Reason C*: Most of the fridges aren't large enough to contain an elephant.\n",
    "\n",
    "     This subtask can be approached as a Sequence-to-Sequence problem where the input is the nonsensical statement and the output is a valid reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will fine-tune a Pre-trained Language Model with [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) library that provides a set of tools for fine-tunning and deploying a wide variety of Pre-trained Language Models. The [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) allows you to explore all the models supported by **Transformers** and even share your own models with the community. In this assignment, you will work with [BART](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/bart), a pre-trained Sequence-to-Sequence model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fine-tuning a Pre-trained Language Model usually requires a great amount of time and computational resources. Your personal computer will not be enough. In order to complete the assignment, you can work with a reduced version of the dataset and the base version of **BART**:"

    "When working with Neural Networks, there are a large number of random operations such as initializing the weights of the network, shuffling the data for training, or choosing samples. This causes that different training runs of the same model can lead to different results. To ensure reproducibility, i.e. obtaining the same results in the different runs, the random number generator must be initialized with a fixed value known as seed.

    "The scores for the partial training and the full training are so similar that it would appear that the full training does not provide any benefit in this task. However, it should be noted that the test sets in the two cases are different. More importantly, these results are indicative of the limitations of metrics such as *bleu* and *rouge* for evaluating text generation. Take, for example, the following case from the test set:\n",

    "| Beer that is drunk by humans is white | Beer is made of barley and it is a yellow drink | A beer that is drunk by humans is not white. | Beer is brown |\n",

    "The text generated by the full training is a better explanation than the reason generated by the partial training, which is a mere repetition of the nonsensical statement. However, the latter obtains much better scores than the former. Metrics such as *bleu* and *rouge* do not always replace accurately the human judgement."
